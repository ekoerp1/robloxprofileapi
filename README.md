This project is about trying to show what a terminated users or active users profile would look like based on roblox api

to start it go to https://ekoerp1.github.io/robloxprofileapi/?userid= and put the userid in the url im working on other methods to load and as of now the display name and username, discription, account creation date, followers, following, friends, user profile picture, and full body picture are supported if they dont load reload and there will be more soon

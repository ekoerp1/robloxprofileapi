This project is about trying to show what a terminated users or active users profile would look like based on roblox api

to start it go to https://ekoerp1.github.io/robloxprofileapi/?userid= and put the userid in the url im working on other methods to load and as of now the display, discription, account creation date, and followers are supported untill I add more.
